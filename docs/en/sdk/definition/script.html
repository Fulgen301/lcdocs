<h1 id="Objektscripte">Object Scripts</h1>

<div class="text">Object scripts control the complex behaviour of an object. For details on scripting see the <a href="../../sdk/script/index.html">C4Script</a> documentation.</div>

<h2>Creation</h2>
<div class="text">For every object, the engine calls the function <a href="#Initialize">Initialize</a> in the object script when it is created and completed.</div>

<pre class="code"><b>func</b> Initialize()
{
  <a href="../../sdk/script/fn/CreateContents.html">CreateContents</a>(ROCK);
  <a href="../../sdk/script/fn/return.html">return</a>(1);
}
</pre>

<div class="text">An object with this script will be given a rock right after it has been created. The Initialize function is called only when the object has reached full size (a building only when its construction has been completed and a living being only when it is fully grown).</div>
<h2>TimerCall</h2>
<div class="text">Each object definition can define a timer call in its <a href="../../sdk/definition/defcore.html">DefCore</a>. The TimerCall is a function which will be called at regular intervals. The DefCore entry Timer determines the rate of calls. If no rate is specifed, the default value is 35 frames (roughly once per second).</div>
<h2>ActMap.txt</h2>
<div class="text">An active object can also define activity script calls in its <a href="../../sdk/definition/actmap.html">ActMap</a>. The defined StartCall is made whenever an action begins (or repeats), an EndCall is made at the end of each activity. PhaseCall is called at each animation phase step and should only be used for very short animations. The call frequency of PhaseCalls is determined by the speed of the animation.</div>
<h2>#include</h2>
<div class="text">An object script can also include the functionality of another script.</div>
<pre class="code"><b>#include</b> CLNK</pre>
<div class="text">At this position the complete script of the specified object definition (that of the clonk, in this case) is inserted. Obviously, the included definition must be valid and loaded. Declared functions can be overloaded by functions of the same name that occur later in the script. Also see <a href="../../sdk/script/fn/inherited.html">inherited</a>().</div>
<h2 id="Zugangsberechtigung">Access Control</h2>
<div class="text">You can specify an access declaration for functions in object scripts: <table><tbody>
<tr>
<td>public</td>
<td>may be called by the object itself, by the engine, or by other objects</td>
</tr>
<tr class="dark">
<td>protected</td>
<td>may only be called by the object itself or by the engine</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>private</td>
<td>may only be called by the object itself</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table> A special case: the callbacks TimerCall, StartCall, PhaseCall, and EndCall will work even if the function called was declared private (for downwards compatibility reasons) but the functions for all other engine calls (see below) must be declared protected or public.</div>

<div class="text">Functions with no special declaration are public. If you are unsure or don't care, leave your functions public.</div>

<h2 id="ObjektCallsderEngine">Object calls made by the engine</h2>

<h2 id="Control-Funktionen">Control Functions</h2>
<div class="text">At every player command (Left, Up, Right, Down, Dig, Throw, Special, Special2, CursorLeft, CursorToggle, CursorRight) the engine calls the corresponding control function in the script of the currently controlled object of the player. If the function is defined and returns true, the internal handling of the player command is skipped. If the function is not defined or returns false, internal processing is done.</div>
<pre class="code"><b>func</b> ControlThrow()
{
  <a href="../../sdk/script/fn/if.html">if</a> (<a href="../../sdk/script/fn/FindContents.html">FindContents</a>(SPER))
    <a href="../../sdk/script/fn/return.html">return</a>(<a href="../../sdk/script/fn/SetAction.html">SetAction</a>(<i class="string">"ThrowSpear"</i>));
  <a href="../../sdk/script/fn/return.html">return</a>(0);
}
</pre>
<div class="text">If a clonk with this script is carrying a spear and the player hits the throw button, the clonk performs a special throw action. In this case, however, the command is not passed to the other selected clonks as usual. If the clonk does not carry a spear, the function returns 0 and the regular throwing action is performed.</div>
<div class="text">Control functions are also transferred to grabbed (indirectly controlled) objects.</div>
<div class="text">Single and double clicks: for each player command the engine will first call the simple variant of the control function (e.g. ControlDown) and then the more specific variant (i.e. ControlDownSingle or ControlDownDouble). When overloading control functions you should pay attention to catch the correct variant to overload.</div>
<div class="text">ContainedControl: if a directly controlled object is contained in another object (container) the basic commands down (exit), throw (put), up (buy at base), dig (sell at base) are evaluated internally first. Then the command is passed to the container for special handling there. Exception: the commands ControlSpecial, ControlSpecial2, ControlCursorLeft, ControlCursorToggle, ControlCursorRight, and ControlWheelUp/Down are only direct commands and are not passed to the container.</div>
<div class="text">ControlCommand: the engine also performs <a href="#ObjektCallsderEngine">object calls</a> for independently executed commands which have been given directly by the player (i.e. by mouse control).</div>

<pre class="code"><b>func</b> ControlCommand(<b>string</b> strCommand, <b>object</b> pTarget, <b>int</b> iTx, <b>int</b> iTy, <b>object</b> pTarget2, <b>int</b> iData, <b>object</b> pCmdObj)
{
  <i>// Ein Kommando mit Zielobjekt
</i>  <a href="../../sdk/script/fn/if.html">if</a> (pTarget)
    <a href="../../sdk/script/fn/Message.html">Message</a>(<i class="string">"Befehl: %s Ziel: %s Koordinaten: %d/%d"</i>, <a href="../../sdk/script/fn/this.html">this</a>(), strCommand, pTarget-&gt;GetName(), iTx, iTy);
  <i>// Ein Kommando ohne Zielobjekt

    <a href="../../sdk/script/fn/Message.html">Message</a>(<i class="string">"Befehl: %s Koordinaten: %d/%d"</i>, <a href="../../sdk/script/fn/this.html">this</a>(), strCommand, iTx, iTy);
  <i>// Kommando nicht abfangen
</i>  <a href="../../sdk/script/fn/return.html">return</a>(0);
}
</pre>

<div class="text">By returning true the command can be intercepted and internal handling can be prevented. "pCmdObj" is always the object receiving the command, even if the call was transferred by a contained object (see VehicleControl in <a href="../../sdk/definition/defcore.html">DefCore</a>). The script command <a href="../../sdk/script/fn/SetCommand.html">SetCommand</a> does not cause ControlCommand calls.</div>
<div class="text">ControlCommand calls are also transferred to grabbed objects or objects controlled from the inside if these have the VehicleControl flag set. This transferred call is made after the ControlCommand call to the clonk, but before internal handling. So the vehicle, too, has the opportunity to intercept and overload the command.</div>
<div class="text">ControlWheelUp and ControlWheelDown are generated by the mouse wheel (and only when not in an object menu). If they are not overloaded, they will cause ShiftContents commands. That in return could be intercepted in ControlContents.</div>
<div class="text">ControlContents is called when an inventory change is made by direct mouse click, mouse wheel rotation, or a ShiftContents script command (e.g. in ControlSpecial or ControlSpecial2). Here you can perform special actions such as the arming of weapons or custom inventory sounds. If the function is intercepted with a return value true, the inventory change is prevented. Otherwise, the first object with the given id moves to the front of the inventory and a Selection call is made to the newly selected object. If the latter call is not overloaded, the sound effect "Grab" is played for the container object.</div>

<h2 id="Context-Funktionen">Context Functions</h2>
<div class="text">Context functions (Context_ in object scripts) are displayed as entries in the context menu of the object. When calling a context function, the engine will pass a pointer to the calling object as the first parameter (with crew members this is always the object itself). Context functions should always have a valid function description and be declared pubic.</div>

<pre class="code"><b>public</b> <b>func</b> ContextConstruction(<b>object</b> pCaller)
{
  [Bauauftrag|Image=CXCN|Condition=HasKnowledge]
  SetCommand(this(), <i class="string">"Construct"</i>);
  <b>return</b>(1);
}
</pre>

<div class="text">If the condition field is used, the context function is only displayed as a menu entry if the script function defined by the condition field (in this case HasKnowledge) is found in the object's script and returns true. The menu object is passed as the first parameter to the condition function.</div>
